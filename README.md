# Mres_code
The final hard and soft cluster folders contain the hard and soft clusters for the full range of CS thresholds.
Note that the soft clusters are also referred to as ‘simple’ or ‘simp’ clusters and the hard clusters are also referred to as ‘unique’ clusters in the file path names. 

The pval folder contains the code needed to propagate the errors to the cosine similarity values of the pairs of sites. They create files that are needed in the Final_clusts code. 
The final_clusts and Err_predcit files give all of the plots that are used in the dissertation. 
The final_clusts code gives the code used to create the clusters. 
The Err_predcit file gives the code used to create and test the prediction  model.
